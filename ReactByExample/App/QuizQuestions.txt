What property does React use to help identify which items have changed,
are added or are removed?
- key

What is one way to copy all of an objects properties into a new
object literal?
- By using the object spread (...) operator

When a user clicks a connected form element in a React app...
- the state is set first, then the element changes to show the new state

What React library ensures the props passed into a component is the
type your program expects?
- prop-types

To get data from a child component to a parent, no configuration
is necessary.
- False. You need to define a callback and pass it down to the
child, and bind it to one of the child's events.

A function loses access to the scope it was defined in when it
executes in a different scope.
- False. Functions retain access to the scope in which they were
defined. This is know as a closure.


--------------------------------------------------
A callback that is bound to an event on a DOM element receives what object
when that event occurs?
-  an event object containing info about the event

If value is a variable, what does !value evaluate to?
- It evaluates to true when value is false.

What is one way to create a copy of an array while removing some of its elements?
- The filter method on JS arrays

When a user clicks the 'edit' button, how is our app finding the corresponding
array element in the state?
- The handler has been given the array element's index through a closure.

If the variable isFiltered is false, what would the following expression

- the string 'showAll'


-------------------------------------------------------
To pass data to a child component from its parent, where

- True

What is a common use for the reduce() method?
- Deriving a value other than an array from elements within an array.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Why was the app not able to target the correct component when the filter was engaged?
- because rendering fewer elements potentially assigned different indexes than the corresponding guests in the app state

If you `import` or `require` from a directory rather than a file, what file inside that directory will JavaScript look for by default?
- index.js

How did we fix the filter bug?
- By creating IDs for each guest that were independently generated from the array index
