A react component will create a representation of its markup in JavaScript, using basic JavaScript data types, like objects, arrays, and strings. 

This JavaScript representation of the DOM elements is called the Virtual DOM in react.


DOM: (Document Object Model) The interface for managing the elements in an HTML page.


Virtual DOM: A pure JavaScript representation of a DOM tree.

When React renders our code to the real DOM, it will translate our virtual DOM elements
into real DOM elements. 


React tries to manipulate the real DOM as little as possible. 

When the data changes, React compares the previous and current virtual DOM and
figures out the minimal changes needed to update the real DOM. 

So if we previously had a ordered list with two list items, and we needed to add
a third, React reference the previous virtual DOM and adds a third LI item.
