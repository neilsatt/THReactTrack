Container Component:
  Redux aware component that usually defines no markup of its own but instead relies on composing presentational
  components into a cohesive UI

Logical Component:
  Presentational component that has its own state to manage and may or may not make use of
  React lifecycle events

Pure Component:
  Presentation component that is implemented as a pure function. These components are passed props and
  return markup, no questions asked, no side-effects. That means they do not manage a state of their own
  and do not take part in React life cycle events.

Component Hierarchy:
  A composition of React components represented as a tree that depicts the component structure.
