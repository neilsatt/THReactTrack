Action Type:
An action type in Redux represents an explicit action type that will
occur within the application. It is expressed in JavaScript as a string constant.

Reducer:
A Redux construct that is responsible for maintaining a specific portion of the
Redux store, which holds the app's state. In JavaScript, a reducer is implemented as a pure function
that takes two arguments, the current state and the action being taken, and produces the next state.
In order for Redux to work properly, Reducers must not mutate the current state. In other words, the state
for a reducer must be treated as immutable.


Actions:
Explicit events that occur in our application represented by a type and any relevant metadata associated
with the action.

Action Creators:
In Redux, a construct for generating an action.
