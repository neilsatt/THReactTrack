A pure component is:
 A component known as a stateless function in React because it does
 not manage its own state.

Which are true about logical components?
- They will often render a view but will also take part in React lifecycle events
  and/or manage an internal state.

You may only have one container component in an application.
- False. You may have several container components that propagate data
down to presentational components

What is a good pattern to follow when building your components?
- Start with components that have no dependency on other components
  and work backwards from there.
